    <h2>character of boys</h2>
    <p>It is said girls are bad,but according to my opinion the same goes for boys.They sweet talk you.But after they get want they want that is after  your back touches the ground,you are finished. They will<strong> dump</strong>  you like a useless rag.
        Hmm but that does not apply to of them actually. Some are very <em> honest</em> but since a nut spoils the whole soup I may as well say that for all of them.</p>
