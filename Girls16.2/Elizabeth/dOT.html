		  <P>The burst of a humanbeing means modelling from the head to the shoulder part of the human.Also,in-the-round relief in claywork means seeing the work from all angles.</P>
		<h2><em>Modelling Material.</em></h2>
		<p>Modelling means adding and subtracting of claywork bit by bit to acquire desirable shape.</p>

		  <ul>
			  <li>Put down your<strong> idea development.</strong></li>
			<li>Grind your clay into powdery form.</li>
			  <li>Add a <strong>maximum</strong> amount of water to mix with clay to become plastic(sticky).</li>
			  <li><strong>Knead the clay until it becomes leather-hard on the sackboard.</strong></li>
			  <li>Use the frog to <strong>wedge</strong> the clay to check whether knead was done.When there are particles(pores) in it,it means knead is not done.</li>
			  <li>Make your slabboard with the <strong>thickness of 5inches.</strong></li>
			<li>When you are done,the clay you made for modelling,you start carving to get shape a humanbeings head.Doing that you start from the base.</li>
			  <li><strong>Draw</strong> the eye on the clay you have mounted.</li>
			  <li>Start carving the eye from where you made your outline,<strong>bit by bit.</strong></li>
			<li>When you are done,do the same for the other features(the ears,the mouth,the forehead,the hair,the eyebrown.</li>
			<li>Carve the up to get the neck to the shoulder.</li>
			  <li>Make sure that the <strong>head-length</strong> is equal to the length of the  shoulder.</li>
			<li>When you are done,check whether they are in order.</li>
			<li>Use the foam to smoothen it.</li>
			<li>This is end.Wash your tools for safety purpose.</li>
