        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Exercise your hand by making it straight</li>
            <li>Move it either clockwise or anti-clockwise till you feel pains in your hands.Again,you move it the horizontal way and the vertical way</li>
            <li>Then go back to your tool and your material</li>
            <li>When you are sure you haare a perfect circle,you do the same for horizontal and vertical to divide into equal parts two.</li>
            <li>Then draw an horizontal line at the bottom of the circle where it ends. </li>
            <li>When you are done add another division line in between the first horizontal line and the second one.</li>
            <li>Extend the vertical line out of the circle</li>
            <li>Draw another horizontal</li>
            <li>To make easier for you,you number the four horizontal lines you drew either "x,x1,x2,x3" and the others</li>
            <li>Draw a straight line(vertical) from the edges of "x"to "x2"</li>
            <li>Then you draw a diagonal line (\,/) to join the end of the edges to the last line which is the  "x3" leaving spaces this (\) and this (/)</li>
            <li>When you are done, join the lines together from the ends with an horizontal line where you ended to form the chin of a human being</li>
            <li>Again,to draw the eye,draw an oval of the same sizes 5times from any end tothe other on line "x"</li> 
            <li>When you are done check where the spaces and sizes of one oval is eqaul to the at the other side.Then go above the eye a little bit to eye brown.</li>
            <li?>To draw the nose, go to line "x1".The holes for breathing is in line with the first edges of the eye.Draw three circles,the last two are small and the middle is big</li?>
            <li>When you are done,clear the lines of the two small circle that has fused inside the big circle</li>
            <li>Next is to draw the mouth.It goes this way,the end tips should be line with the pupil of th eye</li>
            <li>Next one to draw  is the ear.Start drawing the in line with th eye brown outside the circle to the "x1"</li>
            <li>Last one you should do is to draw the hair.You can decide to draw it far away from the eyebrown or a little bit above the eyebrown.</li>
