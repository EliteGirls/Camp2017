        <h1>WHAT I HAVE LEARNT SO FAR</h1>
        <p1>So when I was coming to the ELiTE camp,I had soo many expectations,I actually taught at once we would start building roborts and other heavy equipments,then when we begand and I got to know that there are many basic things we did not know.For instance how to wire up an LED was a problem so then if we can't wire up an LED then how do we build the robot.Basically  we need to know the basics before we leaarn the higher things.</p1>
        <p2>Now talking about html,wow I can't beleive I've created my own website.Html after the second day was easy,all you need to know is what to use at a particular point in time and how to type it and if only it is correct you will have the results</p2>

        <p3>OKay its time to talk about python.I have to confess when I heard the name I taught we were going to learn about python(animal) or maybe it was about how the python behave or at least something related to it.So there I was in the python class and the first thing we learned was how to use the print function and the pwd,cd,ls and other stuffs which were by the way boring.I was like how does learning these affect me in real life situation so someone asked the question and I was saved from asking the question.The tutor was like  you can use it to write codes for games and other stuffs.Hours in python class sometimes goes fast and other times when you want it to go fast it rather tends to go slow.You can be in python class and the teacher will be talking and you are actually listening but you don't understand what she is actually trying to say. This is a list of of things I have learnt in python class
    <ul><li><strong>how to create functions</strong></li>
            <li><strong> how to create variables</strong></li>
            <li><strong>what a string is</strong></li>
            <li><strong>what a float is </strong></li>
            <li>how to use the function index</li>
            <li><strong>what a Boolean is</strong></li>
            <li><strong>how to use the append function</strong></li>
            <li><strong>how to use the extend function</strong></li>
            <li><strong>how to use the insert function</strong></li>
            <li><strong>I also learnt what control flow and loops are and how to use them</strong></li></ul></p3>

        <p4>Now it is time to talk about the almighty Arduino,even on the first day it was't easy how to fix an LED was a huge problem even with the diagram before us.Arduino is also kind of strange even the name sounds strange"A-R-D-U-I-N-O".Ok in arduino class I prefer it when Stanley teaches us,when he is teaching he adds jokes and makes some silly comments which makes the class interesting.Also in the arduino class you can have the sketch there and you don't even know where to plug the pin.At other times to you will be able to connect everything and you will be having problems with the coding.Most of the time for me I do everything but fail to the the tool tab if I have selected the port and the nana board.Where I really had problems with was with the buttons.At first I didn't know how to connect it,how to connect it and where to connect it and after I figured it out I had to now deal with the code.I seriously had to stay up learing it and practising it.It several days like almost three days to understand it and then had to catch up</p4>
