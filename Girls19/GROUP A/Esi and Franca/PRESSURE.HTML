		<h1><u><marquee>PRESSURE</marquee></u></h1>
<p>Pressure is defined as force per unit area<br>P=F/A <br>where F is the Force, A is Area and P is Pressure.<br>From the above expression,a large force on a small area produces a high pressure and a small force on a large area produces a low pressure.<br> Therefore,pressure increases as force increases and area decreases. </p>
		
		
		
		
		<p><strong><u>Example:</u></strong>A plastic block weighing 25N has dimensions 34cm by 25cm by 10cm. What is the greatest pressure and the least pressure it can exert on the ground?</p>
		
		<p><em><u>Solution:</u></em>
Force=25N<br>
dimensions=0.34x0.25x0.1<br>
Surface Area A1=0.34x0.25=0.085m2<br>
Pressure P1=25/0.085=294Pa
Surface Area A2=0.25x0.1=0.025m2<br>
Pressure P2=25/0.025=1000Pa<br>
Surface Area A3=0.34x0.1=0.034m2</p>
