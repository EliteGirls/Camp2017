		<h2><u><marquee>NEWTON'S LAW OF GRAVITATION</marquee></u></h2>
		<p>Sir Isaac Newton made a study on the forces between bodies. He made a conclusion that:</p>
			<ol>
		<li>Any two object in the universe attract one another </li>
		<li>The force becomes less when the object  become more distant from each other</li>
		<li>The magnitude of the force depends on the magnitude of their masses.</li>
