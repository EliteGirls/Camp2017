		<h1>Slavery In Ghana
		</h1>
		<p>In Ghana,slavery started from the Ashanti Kingdom.There were wars between ethnic groups and soon the Ashanti kingdom became the greatest.However,the Europeans came to the then times Gold Coast and soon they were made slaves.For several years people were capture and             sent to other countries to be treated as slaves.It was so pathetic,women who managed to get pregnant with molatos were free but the others were kept in <em>castles ans forts.</em>Horrible and painful marks were made for identification.They bath once a year in a river at the Gold Coast castle.Finally we gained independence with the help of the Big Six.However Ghanaians go through slavery indirectly through lottery.You fill in forms ,get the opportunity and when you are finally there, you either do what they tell you to do horrible job.Slavery is outmoded. </p>
