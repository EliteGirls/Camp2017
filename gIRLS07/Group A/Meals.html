        <p>Food is one of the aspects that interests her most. She finds it difficult sticking to one type of meals for a long time. She will crave for fried rice today and appear to want to have it every day. But a few days afterwards, she grows tired of the fried rice and wants jollof rice.</p>
        <p>She has learnt how to prepare plain rice and stew. She has started learning how to prepare Banku but not until her mum has shouted on her continuously for two weeks. She had disagreed to learn Banku because she cannot wait to learn to prepare jollof rice. </p>
