        <p class="paragraph">Cockroaches undergo incomplete metamorphosis.that is their life cycle consist of only three stages.ie.egg,nymph and adult(imago).
        The male cockroach uses it's style to introduce sperm into the female.The egg is stored in a purse-like case called the ootheca,but are fertilised on their way out.The ootheca is carried in the egg pouch. The ootheca is deposited into various places such as crevices, where the eggs will undergo incomplete metamorphosis by undergoing ecdysis six times (ecdysis is the shedding of the exoskeleton to enable growth to occur) and hatch into nymphs. The nymphs are sexually immature, unlike the adult cochroaches. However, their habitats and feeding habits are quite similar to each other.The nymph does not have wings but has wing buds where the wings will grow.</p>
