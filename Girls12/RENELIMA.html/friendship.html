        <p>A true friend is someone who accepts your past,supports your present and encourages your future.<br> Friends show their love in times of troubles not in times of happiness.<br>
        True friends are the ones who have nice things to say about you behind your back.<br> That awkward moment when you keep talking and you don't realise your friend walked away.<br>
        Be careful about who you trust and tell ypur problems to.<br> Not everyone who smile at you is your <strong>friend</strong>.<br>A good friend knows all your best stories.<br>A best friend has lived them with you.<br> I don't have attitude,I have standards for the people waho are supposed to be my friends.<br>True friends say good things behind your back and bad things to your face.<br>There are no strangers in this world.<br>There only friend syou have not met yet!<br>
