    <h2>HOW TO SUCCEED</h2>
    <p> "It is said, education is the key to success". And I do believe that. This is because,you can be rich but an educated person can strip your<em>wealth</em><strong></strong>  just by applying simple statistics and logic. </p>
    <p> To know how to succeed, you must first ask yourself what success means to you, what does it mean to be successful according to you. Is success getting all A's, is success helping others,or getting to the peak of your profession or doing things that makes you happy. After you have recognised what success means to you, you can go on to do the things that you are expected to do.  </p>
    <p> The next thing to do is to know the number of years you would want to achieve your aim, reason why you chose that aim and number of years. After you are done, put things in place that will enable you to achieve your aim. Outline  steps you are giong to use to make your success story come true. Make sure those steps to achieving your aim is not too easy that you continue being in your comfort zone and not feel alittle bit of pressure.</p>
    <p>These steps must make you come out of your shell and make you alittle bit uncomfortable.</p>
