            <ol><li><dl><dt><strong>Getting frequent trims </strong></dt>
            <dd>Get your hair trimmed once split ends appear.  This may seem like the wrong thing to do when you are trying to grow out your hair.Get your hair trimmed once you begin to see split ends and this can actually promote hair growth. Split ends come as dry, damaged and brittle parts of your hair and if they are not cut off can blend up with the strands of your hair. If you leave your split ends for a long period of time,you would have to cut a significant amount of your hair because the hair is somewhat damaged.
