 <h1> <em> HOW CONDENSATION REACTION PERFORM POLYPITIDE</em></h1>
    
    <dh>p0lypitide</dh>
    <dl> <dd>A polypitide is a string of amino acid linked together. Amino aci ds are the basic building blocks of proteins.A single polypetide chain might make up the entire primary structure of a simple protein ; more complex protein are formed when two or more polypeptides link together.</dd></dl>

   <h2><strong>condensation</strong></h2>
    <p>
    
    "The condensation (dehydration) of two amino acids to piptide bond (red) with expulsion of water (blue).when a condensation is performed between different part of the same molecule' the reaction  is termed  intermoleculer condensation; in many cases, this lead to ring formation.
