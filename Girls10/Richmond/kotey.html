 <p style ="background-color: green">Life is so good and interesting when you have someone to joke around with. People value material things but I value relationships. There are some people who are rear to come by. But when you meet such people, you must count yourself as being lucky.

    <p>Some of these rear people I was fortunate to have met was my friend Kwesi  Nkansah. I called him my brother because,there are people who are not part of your but are more than family. there are people who will give everything to people they do not know.</p>
