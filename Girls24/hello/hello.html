    <P1><em>The holy trinity refers to the GOD who manifests himself in three personalities.The FATHER,SON AND the HOLYSPIRIT are the three ways GOD can make himself manifest.They are all ONE and so therefore have thesame power and authority.They are the best gifts one can have in life.Every christian has the three as far as he or she has accepted christ and is born again.Salvation is a free gift granted by only Jesus and to only those who surrender themselves totally.</em></P1>
